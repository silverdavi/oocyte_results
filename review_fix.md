Enhancing Data-Driven IVF Counseling: A Review of Integrated Oocyte Quality Assessment and Personalized Cycle Predictions


1. Executive Summary

The paper, "Data-Driven IVF Counseling: Integrating Oocyte Quality Assessment with Personalized Cycle Predictions," introduces a significant advancement in reproductive medicine through its novel dual-model framework. This framework combines a transparent parametric calculator for personalized cycle predictions with an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Vision Transformer (ViT) model for objective oocyte quality assessment.1 A notable strength of this work lies in its explicit commitment to realistic performance limitations and responsible AI implementation, which sets a valuable precedent for the application of AI in sensitive clinical domains.1 The paper demonstrates a strong logical flow, coherence, and largely complete methodology, establishing a solid foundation for its claims.1
While the paper presents a robust and clinically relevant solution, opportunities exist to further enhance its clarity, conciseness, and precision, particularly for a broader scientific audience. Greater specificity in the AI model's training parameters would significantly bolster reproducibility, ensuring that other researchers can accurately replicate the reported findings. Additionally, optimizing the presentation of figures and ensuring all visual elements maximally convey information would improve reader comprehension. A more explicit and structured approach to comparing the proposed framework against traditional "Morphological Scoring" methods would strengthen the comparative analysis and more fully substantiate the paper's core claims of improvement over current subjective practices. The underlying commitment to responsible AI, while present, could be more prominently highlighted to amplify the paper's broader impact on clinical AI development.

2. Structure, Logical Flow, and Coherence

The paper adheres to a conventional and highly effective scientific structure, encompassing a title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, and references.1 This established format provides a clear roadmap for the reader, facilitating straightforward navigation and comprehension of the research progression.
The narrative demonstrates a strong logical progression, commencing with a clear identification of critical gaps in traditional in vitro fertilization (IVF) counseling. The introduction effectively highlights the limitations of population-based statistics and the subjectivity inherent in current oocyte quality assessment methods.1 This well-articulated problem statement naturally leads into the Methods section, where the proposed dual-model framework is introduced as a direct and comprehensive solution designed to overcome these identified shortcomings.1 The paper's design, which addresses both cycle prediction and oocyte quality assessment, reflects a deeply considered approach to a multi-faceted clinical challenge. This comprehensive approach, addressing multiple aspects of IVF counseling, underscores the deliberate construction of a solution that enhances patient care.
A seamless transition is maintained from the methodology to the presentation of findings. The Methods section meticulously details the experimental design and technical aspects of the dual-model framework.1 Subsequently, the Results section directly presents the outcomes of these methodologies, with figures and metrics precisely corresponding to the descriptions provided in the Methods. For instance, the explicit mathematical formulas for the parametric calculator (Equations 2-4) are directly illustrated by the performance figures (Figures 1-2), ensuring a coherent and traceable narrative flow from the experimental design to the observed outcomes.1 This tight coupling between methodology and results reinforces the scientific rigor of the study.
The Discussion section skillfully interprets the results within a broader clinical context, addressing their significance, acknowledging limitations, and proposing logical future directions.1 This interpretation naturally transitions into the Conclusion, which synthesizes the main achievements and reiterates the broader implications and the practical path forward for clinical translation.1 Throughout the paper, a consistent emphasis is placed on key themes such as "personalized," "data-driven," "transparent," and "interpretable" tools, alongside "realistic performance limitations" and "responsible AI implementation".1 This consistent messaging reinforces the paper's core argument and ensures a clear, unified message from the abstract to the conclusion, enhancing the reader's appreciation for the paper's overall design and impact.

3. Clarity, Conciseness, and Precision of Language

The paper generally maintains a high level of clarity, effectively explaining complex concepts within its technical domain.1 The structured approach to presenting the dual-model framework and the effective use of visual aids (figures) significantly enhance comprehension for the target audience.1
Precision is a notable strength in the paper's technical descriptions and reporting of results. Quantitative metrics for model performance are provided with high specificity, including a Pearson correlation coefficient of r=0.421, an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.661, a classification accuracy of 71.1%, and a sensitivity of 97.6%.1 The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture is also detailed with precision, specifying a 12-layer transformer, 12 heads, and 86 million parameters.1 This level of detail is crucial for establishing scientific rigor and facilitating understanding.
Despite its overall strengths, certain areas present opportunities for refinement in clarity, conciseness, and precision. The term "pre-2PN," while defined later in the Methods section as "before pronuclear formation," appears initially in the Abstract and Introduction without immediate clarification.1 A brief parenthetical explanation upon its first mention would significantly improve immediate accessibility for readers less familiar with specific embryological terminology. Additionally, the phrase "black-box accuracy" is somewhat informal for a scientific publication.1 Replacing it with more precise academic language, such as "opaque accuracy" or "lack of interpretability," would enhance the professional tone and scientific precision.
Conciseness could be improved by addressing repetitive phrasing. The terms "clinically meaningful" and "realistic performance" are frequently reiterated throughout the Results and Discussion sections.1 While emphasizing these points is vital for the paper's core message, varying the phrasing or strategically placing these affirmations could reduce redundancy without diminishing their impact. For example, once the "realistic" nature of the performance has been established, subsequent mentions could refer back to this established context rather than re-stating the full phrase.
Regarding precision, the parametric calculator's formula for age-dependent AMH modeling, AMHnormal (age) = f(age-specific percentiles) (Equation 1), is presented abstractly.1 Although references are provided (Lee et al., 2017; Song et al., 2021), a brief, more concrete description of the nature of
f (e.g., "a non-linear function derived from population-level AMH distributions") would enhance precision for readers who may not immediately consult external references. Similarly, before presenting the explicit mathematical formulas for oocyte yield prediction (Equations 2-4), explicitly stating the nature of these "established clinical relationships" (e.g., "an inverse relationship between age and ovarian reserve, and a positive correlation between AMH levels and oocyte yield") would improve precision and contextual understanding for the reader.1 This subtle imprecision in defining the function and the general phrasing creates a minor barrier to immediate understanding, despite strong citations, which runs counter to the paper's stated goal of transparency. Adding a sentence or two describing the form of
f or the nature of the relationships would significantly enhance immediate clarity and reinforce the paper's commitment to interpretability.

4. Effectiveness and Clarity of Figures and Tables

The descriptions for Figures 1-5 are consistently highly effective and clear, accurately conveying the purpose and key findings of each visualization.1 These descriptions often anticipate potential misinterpretations, such as the emphasis on avoiding misleading fixed AMH ranges for Figure 1, and highlight the statistical rigor applied, as seen with cross-validation for Figures 4 and 5.1 The titles are appropriate, and the descriptions imply that the labels and annotations within the figures are well-chosen to support the conveyed information.1
For Figure 1 ("Oocyte yield prediction by AMH level and age"), the description highlights its ability to clearly show age-dependent AMH interpretation and its impact on predicted oocyte yields.1 To further enhance visualization, ensuring the color scheme used for different age groups is colorblind-friendly and employing distinct line styles in addition to color would improve differentiation, especially for print versions.
Figure 2 ("Age-related decline in predicted oocyte yield stratified by AMH percentiles") is described as effectively capturing both natural aging effects and differential impacts based on ovarian reserve, with relevant clinical thresholds explicitly marked.1 Visual representation of these thresholds (e.g., dashed lines, shaded regions) should be unambiguous and avoid cluttering the main data. Optimizing the legend's placement would also be beneficial.
The dual visualization approach of Figure 3 ("Correlation analysis between predicted and true oocyte quality scores"), combining a histogram-based distribution and a traditional scatter plot, is well-justified and effectively explained, conveying both overall correlation and insights into score distribution.1 For a large number of samples (702), scatter plots can suffer from overplotting. Techniques such as alpha blending (transparency), hexagonal binning, or contour plots could be considered to better visualize data density in regions with many overlapping points.
Figure 4 ("ROC curve comparison with statistical validation") is praised for its emphasis on rigorous statistical validation, including cross-validation folds, label-shuffled controls, and effect size, which is critical for demonstrating genuine predictive capability and robustness.1 Ensuring the shaded regions for confidence intervals are distinct but not overwhelming, and using different line styles in addition to color for the various curves, would improve clarity, particularly in grayscale reproductions.
Finally, Figure 5 ("Binary classification performance with cross-validation uncertainty") is described as comprehensive, including key metrics with error bars and a clear confusion matrix.1 To enhance readability, improving the visual connection between the summary metrics panel and the detailed confusion matrix panel, and considering a subtle color gradient within the confusion matrix cells to visually represent the magnitude of counts/percentages, would be beneficial.
The consistent identification of opportunities for visual enhancement across all figures points towards a broader need for a cohesive and accessible visual strategy. Implementing a unified visual language—consistent fonts, line weights, color palettes, and annotation styles—would significantly enhance the professional appearance of the paper and improve the ease of interpretation. Actively considering accessibility, such as through colorblind-friendly palettes and redundant encoding, is crucial for maximizing the reach and impact of medical research, aligning with best practices for scientific communication.
To provide a consolidated view of the oocyte quality assessment model's performance and its comparison to various baselines, a summary table is highly valuable. This table would allow for rapid and direct comparison of the model's performance against all relevant benchmarks, clearly highlighting its strengths and acknowledged limitations at a glance.

5. Completeness and Reproducibility of Methodology

The methodology section (Section 2) provides a strong foundation for reproducibility, particularly for the core models.
Dataset and Study Design (Section 2.1): The paper clearly identifies the publicly available time-lapse embryo dataset by Gomez et al. (2022).1 It specifies the number of samples (702), key data characteristics (quality scores ranging from 0.004 to 0.999 with a mean of 0.592 ± 0.287, and binary blastulation labels with 66.7% successful outcomes).1 The clinical context, including ICSI cycles performed at the University Hospital of Nantes between 2011-2019 using Embryoscope time-lapse imaging systems, is also provided.1 The explicit mention of "8-fold stratified sampling" for cross-validation offers a clear and reproducible method for data splitting and validation.1 This foundational information is excellent for enabling reproducibility.
Parametric Cycle Prediction Calculator (Section 2.2): The core principle of incorporating "established clinical relationships through transparent mathematical models" is well-articulated.1 Crucially, explicit mathematical formulas for
Predicted Oocytes (Equation 2), Base(age) (Equation 3), and AMH Multiplier (Equation 4) are provided, making this component highly reproducible.1 The sources for age-specific AMH percentile distributions (Lee et al., 2017; Song et al., 2021) are clearly cited.1 While these citations are valid, the parametric model's reproducibility implicitly relies on external references for the exact derivation of
AMH Percentile(age). To enhance immediate interpretability and self-contained reproducibility, including a small, concise table of representative AMH percentile values (e.g., 10th, 50th, 90th percentiles) for a few key ages (e.g., 25, 30, 35, 40, 42) directly extracted or derived from the cited literature would allow readers to immediately grasp the age-dependent decline in AMH and validate the AMH Multiplier without external consultation.
Oocyte Quality Assessment Model (Section 2.3): The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture is well-specified as "ViT-Base/16" with details on its components, including 12 transformer layers, 12 multi-head self-attention mechanisms, 86 million parameters, and the use of 16x16 patches for image tokenization into 196 patches.1 These are standard configurations within the ViT family, contributing significantly to reproducibility. Input image characteristics (224x224 pixels, acquired post-ICSI but before pronuclear formation) and the comprehensive image acquisition protocol (Embryoscope system, 635 nm LED light source, Hoffman's contrast modulation optics, images captured every 10-20 minutes) are detailed.1 The comprehensive list of performance evaluation metrics and statistical validation methods is also a strong point.1
However, the general statements regarding the Vision Transformer model's training parameters present the most significant bottleneck for exact replication. While "normalized for brightness and contrast" is mentioned, the exact method (e.g., min-max scaling, Z-score normalization) is not specified, which could lead to slight variations in replicated results.1 Furthermore, general statements such as "Batch size optimization for available computational resources," "Learning rate scheduling with adaptive adjustments," "Early stopping based on validation performance," and "Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting" lack the specificity required for exact replication of the training process.1 In deep learning, even minor variations in these hyperparameters can lead to noticeable differences in model performance. Without precise details on the optimizer used (e.g., AdamW), its hyperparameters (e.g., initial learning rate, weight decay, beta values), the exact batch size, the specific learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine annealing with warm-up epochs), and the precise early stopping criteria (e.g., monitored metric, patience, minimum delta), achieving true reproducibility becomes challenging. To fully align with its transparency and reproducibility goals, the authors should provide these exact hyperparameters. A small, dedicated table summarizing these precise parameters would be invaluable and greatly enhance the paper's scientific merit.

6. Interpretation and Presentation of Results

The results section effectively presents and interprets the data, directly supporting the claims made in the abstract and introduction.1
Dataset Characteristics (Section 3.1): The presentation of dataset characteristics, including the 702 samples, quality score range (0.004-0.999, mean 0.592 ± 0.287), and blastulation outcome distribution (66.7% positive), is clearly interpreted as reflecting "typical clinical IVF success rates" and confirming the "dataset's clinical representativeness".1 This effectively sets the context and validates the relevance of the data for the subsequent analyses.
Parametric Cycle Prediction Calculator Performance (Section 3.2): The results effectively demonstrate the calculator's ability to show "transparent relationships between patient-specific factors and predicted oocyte yields".1 Figure 1 illustrates that higher AMH values consistently predict better retrieval outcomes, with the effect being most pronounced in younger patients, while explicitly avoiding misleading fixed AMH reference ranges.1 Figure 2 demonstrates age-related decline in oocyte yield across AMH percentiles, capturing both natural aging effects and differential impacts based on ovarian reserve, consistent with clinical observations.1 The inclusion of clinical thresholds (good/poor prognosis, AMA threshold at 35 years) further enhances the clinical relevance and interpretability of these findings.1
Oocyte Quality Assessment Model Performance (Section 3.3):
The Vision Transformer model demonstrated realistic, clinically meaningful performance. The prediction correlation analysis (Section 3.3.1) shows a Pearson correlation coefficient of r=0.421(p<0.001), which is appropriately interpreted as indicating "moderate but statistically significant predictive capability".1 The dual visualization approach, combining a histogram and a scatter plot, provides a nuanced insight into the model's behavior across various quality ranges.
The ROC curve analysis (Section 3.3.2) further strengthens the model's validation, with an AUC of 0.661, clearly interpreted as "significantly above random chance (0.500)".1 The rigorous statistical validation against "label-shuffled controls" (p < 0.001, Cohen's d=2.85) is well-presented and explicitly interpreted as confirming "genuine predictive capability rather than overfitting artifacts".1 This directly and effectively addresses a common and critical concern in AI model evaluation.
The classification performance (Section 3.3.3) reveals 71.1% accuracy and a notably high recall (sensitivity) of 97.6%.1 This high recall is clearly interpreted as "excellent sensitivity for identifying successful blastulation candidates".1 The candid acknowledgment of modest specificity (23.1%) is coupled with a valuable clinical interpretation: the model "errs on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion," which is deemed "a conservative approach appropriate for reproductive medicine where false negatives carry higher clinical costs than false positives".1 The appropriate use of cross-validation error bars to quantify uncertainty and demonstrate model stability is also a strong point.1
Consistency of Baseline Comparisons: The random classifier and label-shuffled baselines are consistently and rigorously compared in the results, particularly in Figures 4 and 5, with clear statistical validation and effect sizes reported.1 The majority class baseline (66.7% accuracy) is implicitly compared to the model's 71.1% accuracy.1 However, the absence of a direct quantitative comparison to "Morphological Scoring" in the Results section represents a missed opportunity to fully substantiate a core claim of the paper regarding improvement over current subjective methods. While the paper relies on qualitative statements in the Introduction and Discussion about its subjectivity and limitations, a numerical benchmark against human embryologist performance (even if derived from literature or a small internal validation study) would be significantly more impactful and persuasive. If direct, comparable quantitative data is genuinely unavailable, explicitly stating this limitation within the results section would enhance scientific rigor. The primary improvement offered by the AI model in this context is in objectivity, consistency, and scalability, which can be emphasized.

7. Discussion: Interpretation, Limitations, and Future Directions

The discussion section effectively interprets the findings, transparently acknowledges limitations, and proposes logical future research directions.
Effective Interpretation of Findings (Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3): The discussion effectively interprets the framework's clinical utility, highlighting how it addresses "critical gaps in current IVF counseling" and provides "evidence-based, personalized predictions".1 The emphasis on age-dependent AMH interpretation as a "significant improvement over current practice" is well-articulated, supported by concrete examples of AMH decline with age (from ~1.8 ng/mL at age 25 to ~0.18 ng/mL at age 42).1
The nuanced interpretation of the oocyte quality assessment model's "moderate but modest predictive capability" is a significant strength.1 This is justified by stating that it reflects "realistic performance on genuine clinical data where perfect prediction is inherently impossible due to biological complexity".1 The interpretation of high sensitivity (97.6%) as minimizing false negatives (a conservative, clinically appropriate approach in reproductive medicine) and modest specificity (23.1%) as erring on the side of inclusion is a thoughtful and valuable clinical perspective.1 While the predictive accuracy may appear moderate compared to benchmarks in other domains, its clinical meaningfulness in IVF counseling stems from its ability to provide objective, consistent, and early insights that are currently unavailable or highly subjective, thereby reducing uncertainty and improving consistency in patient counseling and decision-making. The reinforcement of statistical validation (cross-validation, label-shuffled controls, Cohen's d) for demonstrating genuine predictive signal is strong and well-reasoned.1 The clear enumeration of advantages (Objective Assessment, Personalized Predictions, Transparent Methodology, Integration Capability) is highly effective in summarizing the framework's value proposition relative to traditional, often subjective, methods.1
Thorough Acknowledgment of Limitations (Section 4.4): The paper is commendably transparent and comprehensive in acknowledging its limitations. These include the "Performance Ceiling" (attributing moderate correlation to inherent biological complexity), "Dataset Scope" (potential limitations in generalizability across diverse populations and systems), "Temporal Considerations" (the inherent prediction challenges due to the time gap between early oocyte assessment and later blastulation outcomes), and "Technical Requirements" for clinical implementation (variability in infrastructure).1 This frankness significantly enhances the paper's credibility and scientific integrity. The paper's realistic portrayal of AI limitations is commendable. While the Vision Transformer model offers objective assessment, its internal decision-making processes remain less transparent than the parametric model. This aspect, inherent to many deep learning models, is a subtle challenge within the broader discussion of comprehensive AI responsibility.
Logical and Relevant Future Directions (Section 4.4): The proposed future research directions logically extend directly from the identified limitations and the current work's findings. Suggestions such as "expanding training datasets across multiple centers" (addresses dataset scope), "investigating ensemble approaches combining morphological and molecular markers" (builds on current image-based assessment), and "developing dynamic prediction models that incorporate time-series information throughout embryo development" (addresses temporal considerations) are all actionable, relevant, and demonstrate a clear path forward for the research.1 Further research into explainable AI (XAI) techniques for the image-based model would be a significant and growing area to address the interpretability challenge of the ViT component.
Clinical Translation Considerations (Section 4.5): This section is a crucial and well-placed addition, outlining practical steps and considerations essential for moving the research into clinical practice. These include validation requirements (multi-center studies), regulatory considerations, clinician training and adoption strategies, and ethical considerations.1 This demonstrates a practical and responsible understanding of the entire research-to-practice pipeline.
Broader Impact on Reproductive Medicine (Section 4.6): The discussion on the broader impact of evidence-based, data-driven approaches and responsible AI implementation is a strong concluding point for the discussion section, positioning the work within a larger context of medical innovation.1

8. Abstract and Conclusion Alignment

Both the abstract and the conclusion accurately and concisely summarize the paper's core elements, demonstrating exceptional alignment with the detailed content presented in the main body of the paper.1
The abstract precisely identifies the "dual-model framework" as the main contribution, outlining the methods: a parametric calculator for oocyte yield prediction and a Vision Transformer model for oocyte quality assessment, utilizing the publicly available Gomez et al. dataset.1 It concisely presents key findings, including the parametric calculator's transparent relationships between age and AMH levels, and the ViT model's moderate correlation (
r=0.421), 71.1% classification accuracy, and high sensitivity (97.6%).1 The abstract also effectively conveys the clinical utility and the acknowledgment of realistic performance limitations, setting appropriate expectations for the reader.
The conclusion effectively reiterates the main findings and contributions, emphasizing the framework's ability to address "critical limitations in current clinical practice" and provide "evidence-based tools for more accurate, individualized patient counseling".1 It re-highlights the value of age-dependent AMH interpretation for the parametric calculator and the realistic performance, particularly the high sensitivity, of the oocyte quality assessment model.1 The conclusion also strongly reinforces the paper's commitment to "responsible AI implementation" and "honest performance reporting," aligning with the broader thematic emphasis throughout the manuscript.1
There are no significant discrepancies, misrepresentations, or omissions that would mislead a reader. While the abstract and conclusion effectively summarize the paper, their framing could subtly emphasize the novelty of the approach beyond just "integrating" two models. The specific way these models are integrated, and the underlying philosophy behind it—leveraging a transparent parametric model for interpretability alongside a data-driven AI model for complex pattern recognition, all while prioritizing honest performance reporting—is arguably more novel and impactful than a simple combination. The paper's strength lies in its nuanced and responsible approach to AI in a sensitive medical field. Therefore, a subtle enhancement in phrasing could highlight this deeper nuance and unique balance. For example, a revised phrasing might emphasize that the framework "uniquely balances transparent, interpretable parametric predictions with data-driven AI assessment, prioritizing clinical utility and realistic performance over opaque 'black-box' accuracy." This slight rephrasing would immediately signal the paper's distinctive philosophical stance and deeper contribution to a busy reader or reviewer, enhancing its perceived novelty and impact.

9. Recommendations for Enhancements

To maximize the paper's impact and strengthen it for peer review, the following enhancements are recommended:
Amplify the "Responsible AI" Narrative: The paper's strong underlying commitment to transparency, interpretability, and realistic performance is a significant asset. This theme could be made more explicit and prominent throughout the manuscript. Consider adding a sentence in the Introduction that explicitly frames the paper as a model for responsible AI development and deployment in sensitive clinical domains. A dedicated subsection in the Discussion, such as "Responsible AI in Reproductive Medicine: A Framework for Trust and Utility," could consolidate and amplify this critical message. The Conclusion should strongly reiterate this as a key takeaway for the broader AI in healthcare community, highlighting its implications beyond just IVF counseling.
Strengthen Comparative Analysis with Morphological Scoring: The absence of a direct quantitative comparison to traditional morphological scoring in the results section is a notable gap. If direct quantitative data is obtainable (e.g., from a comprehensive literature review of human embryologist performance metrics or a small internal validation), it should be integrated into the results section, potentially within the proposed summary table (Table 1). If direct comparison data is genuinely unavailable, this limitation should be explicitly acknowledged within the results section. In the discussion, it could then be emphasized that the primary advantage of the AI model is its consistency, objectivity, and potential for scalability, rather than solely claiming superior predictive accuracy.
Enhance Reproducibility of AI Training Parameters: Provide granular details on the Vision Transformer model's training parameters. This includes explicitly stating the optimizer used (e.g., AdamW), its exact hyperparameters (e.g., initial learning rate, weight decay, beta values), the precise learning rate schedule (e.g., cosine annealing with warm-up epochs), the exact batch size, specific early stopping criteria (e.g., patience, minimum delta, monitored metric), and any other data augmentation methods beyond basic resizing and cropping (e.g., random affine transformations, color jitter, their probabilities and ranges). A dedicated table summarizing these precise parameters would be ideal for comprehensive reproducibility.
Refine Language for Broader Accessibility and Precision: Implement the suggestions for clarifying abstract mathematical functions (e.g., f(age-specific percentiles)) and general clinical relationships in the Methods section by adding a brief description of their nature. Review the paper for repetitive phrasing (e.g., "clinically meaningful," "realistic performance") and informal jargon (e.g., "black-box accuracy") to enhance overall conciseness, precision, and readability for a diverse scientific audience.
Optimize Figures for Impact and Accessibility: Conduct a thorough review of all figures to ensure they adhere to a consistent visual style guide. This includes implementing colorblind-friendly palettes, using distinct line styles for clarity, mitigating overplotting in scatter plots, and maintaining consistent visual language across all figures. All legends, axis labels, and annotations should be maximally clear, concise, and avoid obscuring data points.
Consider a "Key Contributions" Subsection: While the abstract and conclusion effectively cover the contributions, a short, bulleted "Key Contributions" subsection at the end of the Introduction or at the beginning of the Discussion could explicitly list the paper's innovations. This would make the paper's unique value proposition immediately apparent to busy reviewers and readers.
Review Citations for Recency and Relevance: A final check to ensure the most recent and impactful literature is cited for key claims, especially for advancements in AI and reproductive medicine, would demonstrate up-to-date knowledge and contextualize the work within the cutting edge of the field.
