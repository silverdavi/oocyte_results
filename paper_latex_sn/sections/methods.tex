\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Dataset and Study Design}\label{subsec:dataset}

This study utilized the publicly available time-lapse embryo dataset by Gomez et al.~\cite{gomez2022timelapse}, comprising 704 time-lapse videos with 2.4M images across 7 focal planes. We extracted 702 embryo samples with complete blastulation outcome data. Each sample included continuous quality scores (range: 0.004-0.999, mean: 0.592 ± 0.287) and binary blastulation labels ($(66.7\%)$ successful outcomes)~\cite{awadalla2021age,zhu2024developmental}. The dataset represents clinical variability from ICSI cycles (2011-2019, University Hospital of Nantes) with embryos cultured using standardized protocols and monitored via EmbryoScope™ time-lapse imaging systems.

Cross-validation used 8-fold stratified sampling to maintain class balance~\cite{hastie2009elements}.

\subsection{Parametric Cycle Prediction Calculator}\label{subsec:calculator}

The parametric calculator incorporates established clinical relationships through transparent mathematical models~\cite{rudin2019stop}.

\subsubsection{Age-Dependent AMH Modeling}

The calculator implements age-specific AMH percentile distributions~\cite{lee2017amh,song2021amh}:

\begin{equation}
\text{AMH}_{\text{normal}}(\text{age}) = f(\text{age-specific percentiles})
\end{equation}

where $f$ represents a sigmoid function parametrized from published age-stratified AMH distributions~\cite{lee2017amh}. The function captures AMH decline: median values decrease from $\approx$ 1.8 ng/mL at age 25 to $\approx$ 0.18 ng/mL at age 42, with 10th and 90th percentiles showing parallel patterns~\cite{lee2017amh}.

\subsubsection{IVF Cycle Prediction Pipeline}

The parametric model implements complete IVF cycle simulation from oocyte retrieval through live birth, incorporating stage-specific attrition rates and patient-specific factors~\cite{seifer2002amh,ovarian_reserve_testing}.

\textbf{Oocyte Retrieval Prediction:}
Oocyte yield combines age effects, AMH adjustments, and optional antral follicle count (AFC) data:

\begin{equation}
\text{Retrieved Oocytes} = \text{Base}(\text{age}) \times \text{AMH Factor}(\text{AMH}, \text{age}) \times \text{Health Factors}
\end{equation}

The age-dependent baseline utilizes a sigmoid function to capture nonlinear decline in ovarian response~\cite{acog2017advanced}:
\begin{equation}
\text{Base}(\text{age}) = \text{sigmoid}(\text{age}, \text{age-specific parameters})
\end{equation}

The AMH factor employs a Gompertz growth function:
\begin{equation}
\text{AMH Factor} = \text{Gompertz}\left(\frac{\text{AMH}_{\text{patient}}}{\text{AMH}_{\text{normal}}(\text{age})}\right)
\end{equation}

When AFC data is available, the model incorporates the Ovarian Response Prediction Index (ORPI):
\begin{equation}
\text{ORPI} = \frac{\text{AMH} \times \text{AFC}}{\text{age}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Attrition Pipeline:}
The model simulates the full IVF process through age-stratified attrition rates:

\begin{align}
\text{Frozen} &= f_{\text{freeze}}(\text{Retrieved}, \text{age}, \text{ORPI}) \\
\text{Thawed} &= \text{Frozen} \times \alpha_{\text{thaw}}(\text{age}) \\
\text{Fertilized} &= \text{Thawed} \times \alpha_{\text{fert}}(\text{age}) \\
\text{Good Embryos} &= \text{Fertilized} \times \alpha_{\text{embryo}}(\text{age}) \\
\text{Implanted} &= \text{Good Embryos} \times \alpha_{\text{implant}}(\text{age}) \times \text{Patient Factors} \\
\text{Live Birth} &= \text{Implanted} \times \alpha_{\text{birth}}
\end{align}

where $\alpha_{\text{stage}}(\text{age})$ represents age-specific attrition rates derived from clinical outcomes, and Patient Factors incorporate BMI effects (polynomial function), ethnicity adjustments, and health condition modifiers (e.g., PCOS enhances oocyte yield by $(20\%)$, endometriosis reduces implantation by $(20\%)$)~\cite{lee2017amh}.

\textbf{Multiple Cycle Projections:}
The framework provides predictions for up to three consecutive cycles, accounting for age progression and cumulative live birth probabilities using probability theory for independent trials with age-dependent success rates.

\subsection{Oocyte Quality Assessment Model}\label{subsec:quality}

\subsubsection{Vision Transformer Architecture}

We implemented a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for oocyte quality assessment~\cite{dosovitskiy2021image,alhammuri2023vision}. The model processes standardized post-ICSI oocyte images (224×224 pixels, acquired immediately after intracytoplasmic sperm injection but before pronuclear formation) through attention mechanisms that capture morphological features relevant to blastulation potential~\cite{zhang2021machine}.

The ViT architecture consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Patch embedding layers (16×16 patches) for image tokenization into 196 patches
\item 12-layer transformer with multi-head self-attention mechanisms (12 heads)
\item Position encoding for spatial relationship preservation
\item MLP classification head with dropout $(0.1)$ for blastulation prediction
\item Model parameters: ViT-Base/16 configuration with 86M parameters
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Image Acquisition Protocol:} Post-ICSI oocyte images were acquired using the EmbryoScope™ time-lapse incubator system (Vitrolife©, Sweden) with a camera under a 635 nm LED light source passing through Hoffman's contrast modulation optics~\cite{gomez2022timelapse}. Images were captured every 10-20 minutes from fertilization through blastocyst development, with analysis focusing on post-ICSI, pre-2PN timepoints. Images were normalized for brightness and contrast, then resized to 224×224 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio through center cropping.

\subsubsection{Training and Validation}

Model training utilized the complete 702-sample dataset with 8-fold cross-validation~\cite{varoquaux2022machine}. Each fold maintained stratified sampling to preserve the $(66.7\%)$ positive class distribution.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Performance Evaluation}

Model performance was assessed using multiple metrics~\cite{litjens2017survey}:

\textbf{Continuous Prediction Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pearson correlation coefficient (r)
\item Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
\item Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Binary Classification Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
\item Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
\item Sensitivity and Specificity
\item Positive and Negative Predictive Values
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Statistical Validation:}
Cross-validation error bars were computed across all folds to quantify model stability. Statistical significance testing used Mann-Whitney U tests~\cite{mann1947test} comparing model performance against baselines: (1) label-shuffled controls, (2) majority class classifier, and (3) random prediction baseline. Effect size calculations used Cohen's d~\cite{cohen1988statistical}. 

\textbf{Baseline Comparisons:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Random Classifier}: AUC = 0.500, accuracy = $(50\%)$
\item \textbf{Majority Class}: Always predicts positive class ($(66.7\%)$ accuracy)
\item \textbf{Label Shuffle}: Same model architecture trained on randomized labels
\item \textbf{Morphological Scoring}: Traditional embryologist assessment metrics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integrated Framework Implementation}

The dual-model framework provides clinical integration~\cite{fda2022clinical}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Parametric Calculator Interface}: Web-based tool allowing clinicians to input patient age and AMH values for immediate oocyte yield predictions.

\item \textbf{Quality Assessment Pipeline}: Automated processing of oocyte images through the trained ViT model, providing quality scores and blastulation probability estimates.

\item \textbf{Combined Reporting}: Integrated output combining cycle predictions with individual oocyte quality assessments for comprehensive patient counseling~\cite{asrm2021counselors}.
\end{enumerate}

All implementations prioritized transparency and clinical interpretability~\cite{topol2019high}, ensuring predictions could be meaningfully discussed with patients and incorporated into clinical decision-making~\cite{beauchamp2019principles}.
