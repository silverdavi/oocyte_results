\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Dataset Characteristics}

Our analysis utilized 702 real embryo samples with quality scores ranging from 0.004 to 0.999 (mean: 0.592 Â± 0.287). The binary classification distribution showed 66.7\% positive blastulation outcomes (468 successful, 234 unsuccessful), reflecting typical clinical IVF success rates and confirming the dataset's clinical representativeness.

\subsection{Parametric Cycle Prediction Calculator Performance}

The parametric calculator successfully demonstrated transparent relationships between patient-specific factors and predicted oocyte yields, providing clinically interpretable counseling tools.

\subsubsection{AMH-Based Predictions}

Figure~\ref{fig:calculator_amh} illustrates oocyte yield predictions across AMH levels and age groups. The model captures the expected relationship where higher AMH values consistently predict better retrieval outcomes, with the effect being most pronounced in younger patients. Importantly, the visualization avoids misleading fixed AMH reference ranges, instead emphasizing the age-dependent nature of AMH interpretation through updated annotations clarifying effects "at any given age" and "at any given AMH level."

    \caption{Oocyte yield prediction by AMH level across age groups. The calculator shows how AMH levels (log scale) predict retrieval outcomes, with younger patients showing better responses at all AMH levels. Note: AMH percentile ranges are age-dependent (e.g., median AMH declines from $\sim$1.8~ng/mL at age 25 to $\sim$0.18~ng/mL at age 42).}

\subsubsection{Age-Stratified Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:calculator_age} demonstrates age-related decline in oocyte yield across AMH percentiles. The model successfully captures both natural aging effects and differential impacts based on ovarian reserve. Patients with higher AMH percentiles maintain better predicted outcomes even at advanced ages, while those with low AMH show steep declines consistent with clinical observations.

Clinical thresholds for good (>15) and poor (<5) prognosis are indicated along with the AMA (Advanced Maternal Age) threshold at 35 years.}

\subsection{Oocyte Quality Assessment Model Performance}

The Vision Transformer model demonstrated realistic, clinically meaningful performance on real clinical data across multiple evaluation metrics.

\subsubsection{Prediction Correlation Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:oocyte_correlation} presents a comprehensive correlation analysis using both histogram-based distribution visualization and traditional scatter plot comparison. The model achieved a Pearson correlation of r = 0.421 (p < 0.001), indicating moderate but statistically significant predictive capability. The histogram approach (left panel) reveals how predicted scores distribute within true quality score bins [0:0.1:1], providing insight into model behavior across different quality ranges. The traditional scatter plot (right panel) confirms the overall correlation pattern with MAE = 0.387 and RMSE = 0.417.

The analysis reveals meaningful predictive signal across quality ranges while highlighting areas of model strength and limitation.}

\subsubsection{ROC Curve Analysis with Statistical Validation}

Figure~\ref{fig:oocyte_roc} presents ROC curve analysis with proper statistical validation through cross-validation folds and label-shuffled controls. The model achieved AUC = 0.661, significantly above random chance (0.500) with rigorous statistical testing. Cross-validation median AUC = 0.655 (range: 0.628-0.665) demonstrates consistent performance across folds. Mann-Whitney U testing confirmed significant superiority over label-shuffled controls (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.85), validating genuine predictive capability rather than overfitting artifacts.

    \caption{ROC curve comparison with statistical validation. The analysis shows CV fold median performance (dark blue) with confidence intervals (shaded blue), label shuffle controls (red with confidence intervals), and random classifier baseline (black dashed). Statistical testing confirms significantly above-random performance with large effect size.}

\subsubsection{Classification Performance with Cross-Validation Uncertainty}

Figure~\ref{fig:oocyte_metrics} provides comprehensive binary classification performance analysis including cross-validation error bars and clean confusion matrix visualization. The model achieved 71.1\% accuracy with notably high recall (97.6\%), indicating excellent sensitivity for identifying successful blastulation candidates. Error bars computed across 8 cross-validation folds demonstrate model stability and provide honest uncertainty quantification. The confusion matrix shows performance metrics: Sensitivity 97.6\%, Specificity 23.1\%, PPV 70.4\%, NPV 84.4\%, highlighting the model's strength in minimizing false negatives while acknowledging modest specificity.
