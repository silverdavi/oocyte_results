\abstract{Assisted reproductive technology (ART) counseling traditionally relies on population-based statistics that inadequately capture individual patient variability in both cycle outcomes and oocyte quality assessment. We present a dual-model framework combining comprehensive parametric cycle simulation with data-driven oocyte quality evaluation to enable personalized IVF counseling. Our parametric calculator implements complete IVF cycle prediction from oocyte retrieval through live birth, incorporating age-dependent AMH percentiles, optional antral follicle count data, stage-specific attrition rates, and patient-specific factors (BMI, ethnicity, health conditions) through established clinical relationships. For oocyte quality assessment, we develop a Vision Transformer model using the publicly available time-lapse embryo dataset (Gomez et al., 2022), analyzing 702 post-ICSI oocyte images (acquired before pronuclear formation, pre-2PN) from standardized EmbryoScopeâ„¢ acquisitions with blastulation outcomes to predict developmental potential. The parametric calculator demonstrates transparent relationships throughout the complete IVF process with multi-cycle projections and cumulative success probabilities. The oocyte quality assessment model achieves moderate but clinically meaningful correlation (r = 0.421) with actual blastulation outcomes and 71.1\% classification accuracy with high sensitivity (97.6\%) for identifying successful developmental candidates. This integrated framework provides clinicians with comprehensive, interpretable tools for evidence-based patient counseling while acknowledging realistic performance limitations suitable for clinical implementation.}
